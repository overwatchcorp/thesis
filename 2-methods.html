<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Methods</h1>
<div id="participants" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Participants</h2>
<p>477 undergraduate students from Reed College in Portland, Oregon participated in an online survey about “attitudes towards gendered pronouns.” Participants were recruited through online advertisements and posters around campus. Notably, this sample is around one-third of the undergraduate student body. Data collection was conducted over a two month period, starting in February 2020. It should also be noted that the global pandemic that occurred in early 2020 shortened our opportunity to collect data.</p>
<p>Participants of all genders were recruited, including cisgender participants. <span class="citation">Tate, Youssef, &amp; Bettergarcia (2014)</span> advocate for the integration of cisgender and non-cisgender gender research into one body of research on gender identity development. They push back on the common assumption that cisgender people do not undergo a period of self-reflection and self-categorization in the maturation of their gender identity. Furthermore, by not excluding cisgender participants from the study, we allowed freer self-categorization e.g. for the inclusion of people who identified as cisgender and non-binary.</p>
</div>
<div id="transgender-inclusive-behavior-scale-tibs" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale (TIBS)</h2>
<p>The Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale was developed by <span class="citation">Kattari, O’Connor, &amp; Kattari (2018)</span> to provide a measure for actions and modes of communication that are inclusive and supportive of transgender people. The TIBS was developed for participants of all gender identities—not exclusively cisgender people.</p>
<p>The TIBS includes a broad array of trans affirming behaviors. This includes several items such as sharing their own pronouns and asking for others’, educating themselves on local policies that may affect transgender people, and speaking out against transphobia in their communities.</p>
<p>Responses were collected as five-point likert scales ranging from “Never” to “Always.” Each participant’s responses were added to produce a score that generally represented how many inclusive behaviors one performed.</p>
<p>While selecting our measures, we elected to use the TIBS in lieu of a measure such as the transphobia scale developed by <span class="citation">Nagoshi et al. (2008)</span>. This was done to generally frame the study as positive and affirming for transgender people. Administering questions about transphobic attitudes to transgender people who are the victims of transphobia and transmisogynistic violence could have been significantly more distressing than asking about affirming and supportive behaviors. Essentially, the TIBS was included as a proxy for how intentionally participants supported and affirmed their transgender peers.</p>
<p>An added potential benefit to administering the TIBS to cisgender participants is that it potentially includes actions that cisgender people had not yet considered doing to support their transgender peers. As data collection progressed, the author received several messages from participants reporting that they had never considered some of the actions, like ensuring that gender-neutral bathrooms were available at events that they organized.</p>
</div>
<div id="transgender-congruence-scale-tcs" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS)</h2>
<p>The Transgender Congruence Scale was developed by <span class="citation">Kozee, Tylka, &amp; Bauerband (2012)</span> to provide a measure for how transgender people feel “genuine, authentic, and comfortable with their gender identity and external appearance.” The TCS was developed for transgender participants. However, we elected to administer the TCS to cisgender participants as well. This was done to avoid presuming that cisgender people have a purely passive relationship with their gender, as is advocated for by <span class="citation">Tate et al. (2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Responses were collected as five-point likert scales ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” Each participant’s responses were added to produce a score that generally represented how congruent one felt with one’s gender identity. The TCS consists of 12 items that include relationships between the participant’s gender identity, their physical appearance and presentation, their body, and their social experience with gender.</p>
</div>
<div id="gendered-pronoun-attitude-survey-gpas" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Gendered Pronoun Attitude Survey (GPAS)</h2>
<p>The GPAS was developed as a broad survey of undergraduate students’ relationships and experiences with gendered pronouns. Many items were phrased similarly to questions from the TCS. However, as this is a very novel area of study, the author created most of them herself in consultation with other gender-diverse peers.</p>
<p>Responses were collected as five-point likert scales ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” In the first block of questions, participants were asked to report their experiences from the past two weeks. This was done to reflect the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) by <span class="citation">Kozee et al. (2012)</span>. The TCS asked participants to reflect on their relationship with gender in the past two weeks.</p>
