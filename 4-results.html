<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Demographics</h2>
<p>I collected gender-related demographic data by asking participants to write in their gender identity and answer a series of yes/no questions: “Are you cisgender?,” “Are you transgender?,” and “Is your gender non-binary?” Answering yes on one question did not force the participants to answer no on others—this treated gender identity as a collection of separate, related labels that participants may or may not identify with simultaneously. Responses for the write-in question were qualitatively coded by me.</p>
<p>Overall, 317 participants identified as cisgender, 81 identified as transgender, and 141 identified their gender as non-binary. It is important to note that there is overlap among these groups. 63 participants said they were transgender and non-binary, 16 participants said they were cisgender and non-binary, and 1 participant said they were cisgender, transgender, and non-binary.</p>
<p>The most common gender themes were woman (<em>N</em> = 220), man (<em>N</em> = 120), non-binary (<em>N</em> = 94), cisgender (<em>N</em> = 36), transgender (<em>N</em> = 26), questioning (<em>N</em> = 24), masculine (<em>N</em> = 18), agender (<em>N</em> = 15), genderfluid (<em>N</em> = 15), and queer (<em>N</em> = 8).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Experiences with Misgendering</h2>
<p>Similar to <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mclemoreExperiencesMisgenderingIdentity2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, we had participants report how frequently they were misgendered and how stigmatized misgendering made them feel. However, unlike <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mclemoreExperiencesMisgenderingIdentity2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, we administered these questions to cisgender people as well. Independent t-tests were used to compare the cisgender and non-cisgender participants. Non-cisgender participants (<em>M</em> = NaN, <em>SD</em> = NA) reported being misgendered more frequently than cisgender participants (<em>M</em> = NaN, <em>SD</em> = NA), <em>t</em>(231) = 21.6, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001.
Non-cisgender participants (<em>M</em> = NaN, <em>SD</em> = NA) also reported feeling more stigmatized when misgendered than than cisgender participants (<em>M</em> = NaN, <em>SD</em> = NA), <em>t</em>(261) = 12.9, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001.</p>

<p>Pearson’s Chi-squared tests were used to compare the misgendering frequency observed in <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mclemoreExperiencesMisgenderingIdentity2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> to the non-cisgender participants in the present study.
There were significant differences when compared to both the study 1 population, <em>X<sup>2</sup></em> (4, <em>N</em> = 864) = 178.18, <em>p</em> = 0, and the study 2 population, <em>X<sup>2</sup></em> (4, <em>N</em> = 902) = 228.69, <em>p</em> = 0.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mclemore_experiences_2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> performed a one-way ANOVA “to compare differences among three gender groups (transgender men, transgender women, and genderqueer)” in misgendering frequency and felt stigma when misgendered.
Because I took a different approach to collecting gender-related demographic data, I elected to perform a factorial ANOVA comparing endorsement of several endorsed identities on misgendering frequency and felt stigma.</p>
<p>There were multiple significant effects of identity endorsement on misgendering frequency.
Cisgender, <em>F</em>(1, 464) = 702.04, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001,
transgender, <em>F</em>(1, 464) = 21.3, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001,
and non-binary identity, <em>F</em>(1, 464) = 40.59, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001, all demonstrated significant effects.
There was no significant effect in women (<em>p</em> = 0.11) or men (<em>p</em> = 0.08) alone.
However, there was a significant effect in transgender women, <em>F</em>(1, 464) = 11.76, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001.
There was not a significant effect in transgender men (<em>p</em> = 0.37).
There was also a significant effect in non-binary women , <em>F</em>(1, 464) = 11.76, <em>p</em> = 0.004,
but not in non-binary men (<em>p</em> = 0.296).</p>
<p>There were also multiple sigificant effects of identity endorsement on felt stigma when misgendered.
Cisgender, <em>F</em>(1, 422) = 210.75, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001,
and transgender , <em>F</em>(1, 422) = 39.81, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001, identities demonstrated significant effects.
However, non-binary (<em>p</em> = 0.15) identity did not show a significant effect.
Neither men (<em>p</em> = 0.51) nor women (<em>p</em> = 0.38) alone showed significant effects, nor did trans women (<em>p</em> = 0.69).
However, trans men, <em>F</em>(1, 422) = 7.41, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001, demonstrated a significant effect.
Neither non-binary men (<em>p</em> = 0.77) nor non-binary women (<em>p</em> = 0.43) demonstrated a significant effect.</p>
<p>Unlike <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mclemoreExperiencesMisgenderingIdentity2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, I also collected participants pronouns. This allowed me to perform a factorial ANOVA with a follow-up Tukey test to examine pronouns, independent of gender, had an effect on misgendering frequency. I will finish this paragraph later lol once i figure out if it’s actually relevant or not lol.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Gender Congruence</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kozeeMeasuringTransgenderIndividuals2012"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> developed the TCS (Transgender Congruence Scale) to measure transgender individuals’ relationship and comfort between their inner gender identity, physical appearance, and social experience of gender. In this study, the TCS was administered to cisgender participants as well.</p>
<p>A single sample t-test revealed that non-cisgender participants (<em>M</em> = 41.39, <em>SD</em> = 8.01) scored lower on the TCS than cisgender participants (<em>M</em> = 46.36, <em>SD</em> = 6.44), <em>t</em>(348.89) = -20.04, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>A factorial ANOVA demonstrated significant effects of cisgender, <em>F</em>(1, 267) = 352.4, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001,
and non-binary identification, <em>F</em>(1, 267) = 10.83, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001,
but not of transgender identification (<em>p</em> = 0.71).
There were also no significant effects in men (<em>p</em> = 0.46), women (<em>p</em> = 0.16), trans men (<em>p</em> = 0.56), trans women (<em>p</em> = 0.64), non-binary men (<em>p</em> = 0.28), and non-binary women (<em>p</em> = 0.33).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Transgender Inclusive Behaviors</h2>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kattariDevelopmentValidationTransgender2018"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> developed the Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale (TIBS) as a method of quantifying the number of behaviors that may support and include transgender people that one regularly does. Scores are a sum of responses on a series of five-point likert scales ranging from “Never” to “Often.”</p>
<p>A single-sample t-test revealed that non-cisgender people (<em>M</em> = 51.34, <em>SD</em> = 9.14) reporting performing more inclusive behaviors than cisgender people (<em>M</em> = 41.98, <em>SD</em> = 9.26), <em>t</em>(304.22) = 10.22, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>A factorial ANOVA demonstrated several significant effects of gender identity on TIBS scores. There were significant effects in cisgender, <em>F</em>(1, 254) = 108.65, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.001, transgender, non-binary, <em>F</em>(1, 254) = 7.24, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.01, man, <em>F</em>(1, 254) = 9.81, <em>p</em> = &lt; 0.01, and woman, <em>F</em>(1, 254) = 7.24, <em>p</em> = 0.08, groups. There was also a significant effect in trans men, <em>F</em>(40, 254) = 1.17, <em>p</em> = 0.23, but not trans women (<em>p</em> = 0.03). There were no significant effects in non-binary men (<em>p</em> = 0.12) nor non-binary women (<em>p</em> = 0.12).</p>
<p>A Tukey post-hoc comparison was used to compare cisgender and non-cisgender men, women, and non-binary people. There were significant gender differences in inclusive behavior. Cisgender men (<em>M</em> = 37.31, <em>SD</em> = 8.92) perform inclusive behaviors less often than non-binary people (<em>M</em> = 49.51, <em>SD</em> = 9.28), transgender non-binary people (<em>M</em> = 53.85, <em>SD</em> = 7.71), trans men (<em>M</em> = 53.43, <em>SD</em> = 9.81), non-binary women (<em>M</em> = 53.88, <em>SD</em> = 5.82), non-binary transgender women (<em>M</em> = 55.25, <em>SD</em> = 5.9), non-binary trans men (<em>M</em> = 60.25, <em>SD</em> = 6.9), and cisgender women (<em>M</em> = 44.43, <em>SD</em> = 8.18).
Non-binary people (<em>M</em> = 49.51, <em>SD</em> = 9.28) performed inclusive behaviors more often than non-cisgender women (<em>M</em> = 43, <em>SD</em> = 13.45).</p>
