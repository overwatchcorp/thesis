Notably, this sample is around one-third of the undergraduate student body. Data collection was conducted over a two month period, starting in February 2020. It should also be noted that the global pandemic that occurred in early 2020 shortened our opportunity to collect data. Participants of all genders were recruited, including cisgender participants. Tate, Youssef, &amp; Bettergarcia (2014) advocate for the integration of cisgender and non-cisgender gender research into one body of research on gender identity development. They push back on the common assumption that cisgender people do not undergo a period of self-reflection and self-categorization in the maturation of their gender identity. Furthermore, by not excluding cisgender participants from the study, we allowed freer self-categorization e.g. for the inclusion of people who identified as cisgender and non-binary. 2.2 Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale (TIBS) The Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale was developed by Kattari, O’Connor, &amp; Kattari (2018) to provide a measure for actions and modes of communication that are inclusive and supportive of transgender people. The TIBS was developed for participants of all gender identities—not exclusively cisgender people. The TIBS includes a broad array of trans affirming behaviors. This includes several items such as sharing their own pronouns and asking for others’, educating themselves on local policies that may affect transgender people, and speaking out against transphobia in their communities. Responses were collected as five-point likert scales ranging from “Never” to “Always.” Each participant’s responses were added to produce a score that generally represented how many inclusive behaviors one performed. While selecting our measures, we elected to use the TIBS in lieu of a measure such as the transphobia scale developed by Nagoshi et al. (2008). This was done to generally frame the study as positive and affirming for transgender people. Administering questions about transphobic attitudes to transgender people who are the victims of transphobia and transmisogynistic violence could have been significantly more distressing than asking about affirming and supportive behaviors. Essentially, the TIBS was included as a proxy for how intentionally participants supported and affirmed their transgender peers. An added potential benefit to administering the TIBS to cisgender participants is that it potentially includes actions that cisgender people had not yet considered doing to support their transgender peers. As data collection progressed, the author received several messages from participants reporting that they had never considered some of the actions, like ensuring that gender-neutral bathrooms were available at events that they organized. 2.3 Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) The Transgender Congruence Scale was developed by Kozee, Tylka, &amp; Bauerband (2012) to provide a measure for how transgender people feel “genuine, authentic, and comfortable with their gender identity and external appearance.” The TCS was developed for transgender participants. However, we elected to administer the TCS to cisgender participants as well. This was done to avoid presuming that cisgender people have a purely passive relationship with their gender, as is advocated for by Tate et al. (2014). Responses were collected as five-point likert scales ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree” Each participant’s responses were added to produce a score that generally represented how congruent one felt with one’s gender identity. The TCS consists of 12 items that include relationships between the participant’s gender identity, their physical appearance and presentation, their body, and their social experience with gender. 2.4 Gendered Pronoun Attitude Survey (GPAS) The GPAS was developed as a broad survey of undergraduate students’ relationships and experiences with gendered pronouns. Many items were phrased similarly to questions from the TCS. However, as this is a very novel area of study, the author created most of them herself in consultation with other gender-diverse peers. Responses were collected as five-point likert scales ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” In the first block of questions, participants were asked to report their experiences from the past two weeks. This was done to reflect the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) by Kozee et al. (2012). The TCS asked participants to reflect on their relationship with gender in the past two weeks. Table 2.1: Pronoun attitude questionnaire items: past 2 weeks Item Description I feel comfortable sharing my pronouns in most settings. I feel comfortable sharing my pronouns in non-academic settings in the Reed community. I feel comfortable sharing my pronouns in classes at Reed. I want to share my pronouns in most settings. I want to share my pronouns in non- academic settings in the Reed community. I want to share my pronouns in classes at Reed. I feel more comfortable sharing my pronouns if I am with people who may have similar gender identities to me. I feel more comfortable introducing myself with my pronouns if someone else does first. I feel more comfortable introducing myself with my pronouns in class if the professor does first. I am concerned that sharing my pronouns will draw unwanted attention to myself in most settings. I am concerned that sharing my pronouns will draw unwanted attention to myself in non-academic settings in the Reed community I am concerned that sharing my pronouns will draw unwanted attention to myself in class at Reed. I feel that the gender that people perceive me as and my pronouns are consistent with one another. I feel that my internal gender identity and pronouns are consistent with one another. I feel that my pronouns represent my gender identity well. If I don’t tell people what my pronouns are, they will misgender me. I don’t need to tell people what my pronouns are, because they usually assume correctly. I feel like people understand me better when I share my pronouns. In the second block of questions, participants were asked to reflect on their experience across their entire time at Reed. These questions drew on participants extended experience at the college and reflection on each semester. Table 2.2: Pronoun attitude questionnaire items: entire time at Reed Item Description In classes at Reed, professors usually introduce themselves with their pronouns In classes at Reed, students usually introduce themselves with their pronouns Enough is being done at Reed to support people who have the same gender as me. 2.5 Demographic Quesitons 2.5.1 Gender-related Demographic Questions 2.5.2 Other Demographic Questions "],
["3-results.html", "Chapter 3 Results 3.1 Demographics 3.2 Experiences with Misgendering 3.3 Gender Congruence 3.4 Transgender Inclusive Behaviors 3.5 Pronouns", " Chapter 3 Results 3.1 Demographics 3.1.1 Gender I collected gender-related demographic data by asking participants to write in their gender identity and answer a series of yes/no questions: “Are you cisgender?,” “Are you transgender?,” and “Is your gender non-binary?” Answering yes on one question did not force the participants to answer no on others—this treated gender identity as a collection of separate, related labels that participants may or may not identify with simultaneously. Responses for the write-in question were qualitatively coded by me. Overall, 317 participants identified as cisgender, 81 identified as transgender, and 141 identified their gender as non-binary. It is important to note that there is overlap among these groups. 63 participants said they were transgender and non-binary, 16 participants said they were cisgender and non-binary, and 1 participant said they were cisgender, transgender, and non-binary. Qualitative themes were decided by the author after examining the data and consulting with a number of gender-diverse peers. The most commonly occuring themes were woman (N = 220), man (N = 120), non-binary (N = 94), cisgender (N = 36), transgender (N = 26), questioning (N = 24), masculine (N = 18), agender (N = 15), genderfluid (N = 15), and queer (N = 8). 3.1.2 Pronouns Participants were asked their pronouns in a write-in box. Pronouns were qualitatively coded by the author. No participants reported using any other pronouns besides he/him, she/her, and they/them. However, many participants reported using multiple pronouns. Table 3.1: Participant pronouns Pronouns N she/her 199 he/him 127 they/them 65 she/her &amp; they/them 35 he/him &amp; they/them 19 all pronouns 9 he/him &amp; she/her 2 3.2 Experiences with Misgendering Adding missing grouping variables: `cis` Similar to McLemore (2015), we had participants report how frequently they were misgendered and how stigmatized misgendering made them feel. However, unlike McLemore (2015), we administered these questions to cisgender people as well. Independent t-tests were used to compare the cisgender and non-cisgender participants. Non-cisgender participants (M = 3.28, SD = 0.96) reported being misgendered more frequently than cisgender participants (M = 1.45, SD = 1.45), t(230.94) = 21.6, p &lt; 0.001. Non-cisgender participants (M = 3.15, SD = 1.3) also reported feeling more stigmatized when misgendered than than cisgender participants (M = 1.59, SD = 1.59), t(261.058643) = 12.9, p &lt; 0.001. Table 3.2: Misgendering frequency for non-cisgender and cisgender participants “How often do people ‘misgender’ you?” Non-cisgender (%) Cisgender (%) Never 6.4 68.8 Rarely 14.0 24.9 Sometimes 30.6 4.7 Often 44.6 1.3 Always 4.5 0.3 Table 3.3: Felt stigma when misgendered for non-cisgender and cisgender participants “I feel stigmatized (looked down upon)when I am misgendered.” Non-cisgender (%) Cisgender (%) Not at all 12.2 68.5 Slightly 20.5 12.0 Somewhat 28.2 13.4 Considerably 18.6 4.0 Very 20.5 2.2 Pearson’s Chi-squared tests were used to compare the misgendering frequency observed in McLemore (2015) to the non-cisgender participants in the present study. There were significant differences when compared to both the study 1 population, X2 (4, N = 864) = 178.18, p = 0, and the study 2 population, X2 (4, N = 902) = 228.69, p = 0. McLemore (2015) performed a one-way ANOVA “to compare differences among three gender groups (transgender men, transgender women, and genderqueer)” in misgendering frequency and felt stigma when misgendered. Because a different approach was taken in collecting gender-related demographic data, we performed a factorial ANOVA comparing endorsement of several endorsed identities on misgendering frequency and felt stigma. There were multiple significant effects of identity endorsement on misgendering frequency. Cisgender, F(6, 448) = 111.97, p &lt; 0.001, transgender, F(448, 448) = NA, p &lt; 0.001, and non-binary identity, F(NA, 448) = NA, p &lt; 0.001, all demonstrated significant effects. There was no significant effect in women (p = NA) or men (p = NA) alone. However, there was a significant effect in transgender women, F(NA, 448) = NA, p &lt; 0.001. There was not a significant effect in transgender men (p = NA). There was also a significant effect in non-binary women , F(NA, 448) = NA, p = NA, but not in non-binary men (p = NA). There were also multiple sigificant effects of identity endorsement on felt stigma when misgendered. Cisgender, F(6, 408) = 42.72, p &lt; 0.001, and transgender , F(408, 408) = NA, p &lt; 0.001, identities demonstrated significant effects. However, non-binary (p = NA) identity did not show a significant effect. Neither men (p = NA) nor women (p = NA) alone showed significant effects, nor did trans women (p = NA). However, trans men, F(NA, 408) = NA, p &lt; 0.001, demonstrated a significant effect. Neither non-binary men (p = NA) nor non-binary women (p = NA) demonstrated a significant effect. Unlike McLemore (2015), participant pronouns were also collected. This allowed us to perform a factorial ANOVA with a follow-up Tukey test to examine pronouns, independent of gender, had an effect on misgendering frequency. I will finish this paragraph later lol once i figure out if it’s actually relevant or not lol. 3.3 Gender Congruence Kozee et al. (2012) developed the TCS (Transgender Congruence Scale) to measure transgender individuals’ relationship and comfort between their inner gender identity, physical appearance, and social experience of gender. In this study, the TCS was administered to cisgender participants as well. A single sample t-test revealed that non-cisgender participants (M = 34.26, SD = 5.5) scored lower on the TCS than cisgender participants (M = 45.53, SD = 6.23), t(348.89) = -20.04, p &lt; 0.001. A factorial ANOVA demonstrated significant effects of cisgender, F(6, 445) = 71.24, p &lt; 0.001, and non-binary identification, F(NA, 445) = NA, p &lt; 0.001, but not of transgender identification (p = NA). There were also no significant effects in men (p = NA), women (p = NA), trans men (p = NA), trans women (p = NA), non-binary men (p = NA), and non-binary women (p = NA). 3.4 Transgender Inclusive Behaviors Kattari et al. (2018) developed the Transgender Inclusive Behavior Scale (TIBS) as a method of quantifying the number of behaviors that may support and include transgender people that one regularly does. Scores are a sum of responses on a series of five-point likert scales ranging from “Never” to “Often.” A single-sample t-test revealed that non-cisgender people (M = 51.34, SD = 9.14) reporting performing more inclusive behaviors than cisgender people (M = 41.98, SD = 9.26), t(304.22) = 10.22, p &lt; 0.001. A one-way ANOVA demonstrated that there was a significant effect of gender F(6, 249) = 26.53, p &lt; 0.001. A Tukey post-hoc comparison revealed that cisgender men (M = 37.31, SD = 8.92) do significantly fewer trans inclusive behaviors than cisgender women (M = 44.43, SD = 8.18), transgender men (M = 55.91, SD = 9.16), transgender women (M = 50.58, SD = 9.97), cisgender non-binary people (M = 45.73, SD = 8.18), non-binary people (M = 49.26, SD = 9.3), and transgender non-binary people (M = 53.85, SD = 7.71). Cisgender women do significantly fewer trans inclusive behaviors than transgender men, transgender women, non-binary people, and transgender non-binary people. Cisgender non-binary people also do fewer trans inclusive behaviors than transgender non-binary people. 3.5 Pronouns 3.5.1 Comfort sharing pronouns 3.5.2 Desire to share pronouns 3.5.3 Concerns about sharing pronouns 3.5.4 Congruence and perception of pronouns 3.5.5 Historical experience at Reed College "],
