Notably, this sample is around one-third of the undergraduate student body. Data collection was conducted over a two month period, starting in February 2020. It should also be noted that the global pandemic that occurred in early 2020 shortened our opportunity to collect data. 3.2 Pronoun Attitude Questionnaire Participants were administered a series of questions about their relationship and comfort with their pronouns. Questions were formatted as five-point likert scales ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” In the first block of questions, participants were asked to report their experiences from the past two weeks. This was done to reflect the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) by Kozee, Tylka, &amp; Bauerband (2012). The TCS was also administered to participants in this study and asked participants to reflect on their relationship with gender in the past two weeks.
