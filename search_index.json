Gendered pronouns are a type of pronoun that identifies the subject’s gender when used (“Preferred gender pronoun,” 2019). For example, in the sentence “she walks the dog,” she is the third person pronoun that replaces the subject’s name. In English, the most common pronouns are “she,” “they,” and “he.” It is important to note that “they” is widely recognized as both a singular and plural pronoun (“They,” 2019). Gendered pronouns are especially important for transgender and non-binary individuals, since their apperance and gender may not match cisnormative expectations. "]
