<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence (add #) them. 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

<!-- On ordering the chapter files:
There are two options:
1. Name your chapter files in the order in which you want them to appear (e.g., 01-Inro, 02-Data, 03-Conclusions). 
2. Otherwise, you can specify the order in which they appear in the _bookdown.yml (for PDF only).

Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd and 00-abstract.Rmd in the YAML file--they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

<!-- The {.unnumbered} option here means that the introduction will be "Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers
on chapters.

# Introduction {-}

Pronouns are small words used in place of nouns in sentences [@Pronoun2020]. Gendered pronouns are a type of pronoun that identifies the subject's gender when used [@PreferredGenderPronoun2019]. For example, in the sentence "she walks the dog," she is the third person pronoun that replaces the subject's name. In English, the most common pronouns are "she," "they," and "he." It is important to note that "they" is widely recognized as both a singular and plural pronoun [@They2019]. 

Gendered pronouns are especially important for transgender and non-binary individuals, since their apperance and gender may not match cisnormative expectations.
