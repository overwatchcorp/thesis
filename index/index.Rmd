# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content (e.g., abstract, acknowledgements) here or
# use code similar to line 22-23 for the .RMD files. If you are NOT producing a PDF, you can delete or silence lines 21-32 in this YAML header.

# Specify the location of the bibliography below
bibliography: references.bib

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete the section entirely, or silence (add #) them. 

If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

```{r include_packages, include = FALSE}
# This chunk ensures that the thesisdown package is
# installed and loaded. This thesisdown package includes
# the template files for the thesis.

<!-- On ordering the chapter files:
There are two options:
1. Name your chapter files in the order in which you want them to appear (e.g., 01-Inro, 02-Data, 03-Conclusions). 
2. Otherwise, you can specify the order in which they appear in the _bookdown.yml (for PDF only).

Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd and 00-abstract.Rmd in the YAML file--they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
-->

<!-- The {.unnumbered} option here means that the introduction will be "Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers
on chapters.

Hello and welcome to my thesis. This will very much be an active document until at least May 1st, when it will be due. Join me as I write about pronouns :-)
