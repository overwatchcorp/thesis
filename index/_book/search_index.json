Responses for the write-in question were qualitatively coded by me. Overall, 317 participants identified as cisgender, 81 identified as transgender, and 141 identified their gender as non-binary. It is important to note that there is overlap among these groups. 63 participants said they were transgender and non-binary, 16 participants said they were cisgender and non-binary, and 1 participant said they were cisgender, transgender, and non-binary. The most common gender themes were woman (N = 220), man (N = 120), non-binary (N = 94), cisgender (N = 36), transgender (N = 26), questioning (N = 24), masculine (N = 18), agender (N = 15), genderfluid (N = 15), and queer (N = 8). 4.2 Experiences with Misgendering Similar to (???), we had participants report how frequently they were misgendered and how stigmatized misgendering made them feel. However, unlike (???), we administered these questions to cisgender people as well. Independent t-tests were used to compare the cisgender and non-cisgender participants. Non-cisgender participants (M = 3.28, SD = 0.96) reported being misgendered more frequently than cisgender participants (M = 1.45, SD = 0.7), t(231) = 21.6, p = &lt; 0.001. Non-cisgender participants (M = 3.15, SD = 1.3) also reported feeling more stigmatized when misgendered than than cisgender participants (M = 1.59, SD = 1.01), t(261) = 12.9, p = &lt; 0.001. Table 4.1: Misgendering frequency for non-cisgender and cisgender participants “How often do people ‘misgender’ you?” Non-cisgender (%) Cisgender (%) Never 6.4 68.8 Rarely 14.0 24.9 Sometimes 30.6 4.7 Often 44.6 1.3 Always 4.5 0.3 Table 4.2: Felt stigma when misgendered for non-cisgender and cisgender participants “I feel stigmatized (looked down upon)when I am misgendered.” Non-cisgender (%) Cisgender (%) Not at all 12.2 68.5 Slightly 20.5 12.0 Somewhat 28.2 13.4 Considerably 18.6 4.0 Very 20.5 2.2 Pearson’s Chi-squared tests were used to compare the misgendering frequency observed in (???) to the non-cisgender participants in the present study. There were significant differences when compared to both the study 1 population, X2 (4, N = 544) = 13.54, p = 0.01, and the study 2 population, X2 (4, N = 582) = 11.41, p = 0.02. (???) performed a one-way ANOVA “to compare differences among three gender groups (transgender men, transgender women, and genderqueer)” in misgendering frequency and felt stigma when misgendered. Because I took a different approach to collecting gender-related demographic data, I elected to perform a factorial ANOVA comparing endorsement of several endorsed identities on misgendering frequency and felt stigma. There were multiple significant effects of identity endorsement on misgendering frequency. Cisgender, F(1, 464) = 702.04, p = &lt; 0.001, transgender, F(1, 464) = 21.3, p = &lt; 0.001, and non-binary identity, F(1, 464) = 40.59, p = &lt; 0.001, all demonstrated significant effects. There was no significant effect in women (p = 0.11) or men (p = 0.08) alone. However, there was a significant effect in transgender women, F(1, 464) = 11.76, p = &lt; 0.001. There was not a significant effect in transgender men (p = 0.37). There was also a significant effect in non-binary women , F(1, 464) = 11.76, p = 0.004, but not in non-binary men (p = 0.296). There were also multiple sigificant effects of identity endorsement on felt stigma when misgendered. Cisgender, F(1, 422) = 210.75, p = &lt; 0.001, and transgender , F(1, 422) = 39.81, p = &lt; 0.001, identities demonstrated significant effects. However, non-binary (p = 0.15) identity did not show a significant effect. Neither men (p = 0.51) nor women (p = 0.38) alone showed significant effects, nor did trans women (p = 0.69). However, trans men, F(1, 422) = 7.41, p = &lt; 0.001, demonstrated a significant effect. Neither non-binary men (p = 0.77) nor non-binary women (p = 0.43) demonstrated a significant effect. Unlike (???), I also collected participants pronouns. This allowed me to perform a factorial ANOVA with a follow-up Tukey test to examine pronouns, independent of gender, had an effect on misgendering frequency. I will finish this paragraph later lol once i figure out if it’s actually relevant or not lol. 4.3 Gender Congruence (???) developed the TCS (Transgender Congruence Scale) to measure transgender individuals’ relationship and comfort between their inner gender identity, physical appearance, and social experience of gender. In this study, the TCS was administered to cisgender participants as well. A single sample t-test revealed that non-cisgender participants (M = 41.39, SD = 8.01) scored lower on the TCS than cisgender participants (M = 46.36, SD = 6.44), t(348.89) = -20.04, p = &lt; 0.001. A factorial ANOVA demonstrated significant effects of cisgender, F(1, 461) = 381.09, p = &lt; 0.001, and non-binary, F(1, 461) = 16.11, p = &lt; 0.001, identification, but not of transgender identification (p = 0.71). There were also no significant effects in men (p = 0.26), women (p = 0.18), trans men (p = 0.61), trans women (p = 0.12), non-binary men (p = 0.82), and non-binary women (p = 0.44). "]
