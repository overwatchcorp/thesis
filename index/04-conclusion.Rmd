## Gender Identity

Gender identity is frequently assumed to be a binary or trinary, i.e. men, women, and—perhaps—non-binary people. In the present study, we created seven artificial gender groups based on answers to a series of questions that disaggregated gender identity (e.g. woman, agender, non-binary) and mode of relating to gender identity (e.g. cis, trans, non-binary). These groups are artificial in the sense that they do not fully convey any one participant's gender. 

"Non-binary" could be someone's gender, or it could be part of how they relate to their gender. There were 14 participants who indicated that they were non-binary, but did not describe their gender identity with the phrase "non-binary." This includes trans men and women, agender people, genderfluid people, and people who describe their gender as, simply, "queer." Within some circles of the trans community, it is understood that "non-binary" is an umbrella term that includes many different genders. However, in the author's experience, outside of the trans community, "non-binary" is commonly misunderstood as a discrete third gender. The data here indicate that this is a significant mistake, as there are numerous robust differences between the cis non-binary, non-binary, and trans non-binary groups. Even within these groups, the present methodology fails to capture many important aspects of gendered experiences. 

For example, the present study intentionally did not ask participants what their sex or gender assigned at birth was. The author believes that this information is generally not as useful as many make it out to be, especially for research focused on social experiences of gender. However, this means that we were not able to make many inferences about, for example, transmisogyny, beyond comparing trans women to the other groups. Present queer discourse recognizes that, while for the purposes of third-parties, trans women and cis women are the same, trans women face unique issues such as transmisogyny—the specific fear and prejudice against trans women. Transmisogyny is a combination of misogyny and transphobia. Other transfeminine people face transmisogyny because they are perceived as trans women, but do not identify as women. Thus, transmisogyny affected/exempt have become possible categories that gendered experiences can fall in to [@hollebAZGenderSexuality2019]. 

Future gender research should expand the lens of gendered experiences and gender identities beyond three genders, but should be careful to not seek out new binaries. At a minimum, gender should be collected in a write-in field, as this does not privilege certain gender identities over others. Even using the themes from a previous study as a definitive list of gender identities should be avoided. For example, no one in the present sample identified as Two-Spirit, an indigenous identity that can have tribe-specific meanings [@ristockAboriginalTwoSpiritLGBTQ2012] and—importantly—does not fit into Western gender systems. A series of checkboxes using data from the present study would fail to include Two-Spirit people. 

Future gender research should also consider the implications that words such as "transgender," "genderqueer," and "non-binary" may carry. For example, while performing the analysis for the present study, the author shared some of her work. She received a number of questions about the "cis non-binary" category. After explaining that placement into the cis non-binary category was based off of how participants responded to questions about being cisgender and non-binary, people generally understood the role the category played. However, this made it clear to the author that "non-binary" is frequently considered a non-cisgender gender identity, and not as a possible way of relating to one's gender that they were assigned at birth. 

Even "non-cisgender" is not a clear category. In order to compare our sample to [@mclemoreExperiencesMisgenderingIdentity2015], we compared their data to participants who indicated that they were not cisgender. However, this was only possible because we did not have any gender-related inclusion criteria and asked participants if they were cisgender. There were multiple differences between the cis non-binary group and the rest of the participants. So, this begs the question, would the participants who fell into the cis non-binary group have responded if we had only sought out non-cisgender participants? Presently, the author does not think she has the right data to answer this question. Future gender-related studies should be careful about possible implications that their inclusion/exclusion criteria carry and be sensitive to local variation.

This also has broader implications for how gender identity is discussed. For example, one common phrase is "trans and non-binary people" (e.g. @thetrevorprojectGuideBeingAlly2020). This could potentially be interpreted as treating transgender people and non-binary people as two seperate groups. However, as we can see from the number of trans non-binary people in the sample, as well as from the diverse array of identities participants reported, the phrase does not perfectly match up to the reality of many gender identities. The author thinks that what's meant by the phrase is "transgender and/or non-binary people" or "non-cisgender people," but this too has its flaws. "Non-cisgender people" then focuses the language on the existence of cis people, potentially making it counterproductive against generally showing an inclusive, trans-competent message. "Transgender and/or non-binary people" may come off as clunky language to people accustomed to the original phrase. The author believes that language used to communicate gender identity should not be fixed and should strive to balance accuracy, clarity, and inclusiveness.
