## Abstract
Gendered third-person pronouns such as “she” are used to refer to people in a mannerthat is congruent with their gender. For many cisgender people, this is an unques-tioned truth. However, for transgender and non-binary people, correct use of one’sgendered pronouns can be as important as one’s chosen name. Transgender literaturehas not yet examined relationships with gendered pronouns in detail. In this study,we developed a survey about relationships with and attitudes towards gendered pro-nouns.  Additionally, two previously validated measures of gender congruence andactive support of transgender people were included in the survey. This was adminis-tered to undergraduates at Reed College, where a significant proportion of the stu-dent body is gender non-confirming, transgender, and non-binary. The sample alsoincludes cisgender people. We found that pronouns are a poor signifier of gender, andthat people of all genders use many different combinations of pronouns. Furthermore,we found that relationships to pronouns is complicated and multivariate. Using pri-mary component analysis, we found that a significant proportion of the data can beexplained by how deeply one is affected by cisnormativity—the systematic privilegingof cisgender people. Ultimately, relationships to pronouns are complicated and deeplyindividual. We also found that cis people generally lag behind trans and non-binarypeople in supporting trans people.  One concrete way that cis people can supporttheir trans peers is by initiating the sharing of pronouns.
